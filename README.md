This is the source code of my personal website [jlgarcia.me](http://jlgarcia.me)

The site is built on [Django](www.djangoproject.com), a Python web framework for
perfectionists. I´m not a perfectionist, but it´s easy to use :) . 
It also uses [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/#), a frontend 
framework written by the [Twitter](http://twitter.com) staff.

Hope you can learn something useful :)

Enjoy!
